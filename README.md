# Class Project Website Template

Copy this template on github, and rename the repo to the name of your project.

Then go to the repo "Settings" and change "Webhook" settings, to "Add a webhook."

Set up the webhook exactly as you see in the image below, so that it sends
JSON push notifications to `https://expo.baulab.info/push`.  To work, it will
need to have the secret pictured.

<img src="webhook.png" style="max-width:100%">

Then whenever you push your website, it will show up on
https://expo.baulab.info/2022-Fall/[username].  Customize your
`index.html`.

Your final project report will be a static HTML website that
shares your insights.  As you develop your
methods, results, and narrative, add content as needed here.
